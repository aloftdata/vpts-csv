Data in VPTS-DP are stored as a CSV file. 
The descriptions of the fields follow the [Table Schema](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/) specifications and are presented below in human-readable form. 

Notes:

- Data rows must be ordered: first by `datetime` then `height` columns.
- To make data exploration (by humans!) more comfortable, it is considered good practice (but not mandatory) that the 
  fields are presented in the same order as in the table below.

Fields indicated with `*` are required (i.e. cannot be empty).
